# Pilot-Monitor

This was a project made in order to monitor users while watching video/show pilots. This device will track the users movement and hearthbeat. The tracked information can be analyzed in order to improve the quality of the pilots/shows. The solution was made to support 100+ devices.

The tracked data will be stored in a google firebase database. One can also see the data drawn in a graph in realtime, or load in previous tracked data in the graph.

## Some pictures of the project - See the "bilder" folder for more!
